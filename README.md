# Calculate-defect-numbers-in-displacement-damage\
**Description:**\
>>>>>These two `python scripts` can be used in `OVITO` to calculate defect numbers and their coordinates in displacement damage.
##Files explanation
**The two dump files(`dump.irradiation` `dump.start`) are results of lammps. Just ignore the last three columns of these two files, we only focus on the coordinates of all atoms! 
**As for two python scripts, one(`Calculate the number of defects.py`) is to calculate the number and one(`A_vacancy_position.py`)is to calculate position of defects!**   
**The other three files are the defect number results of two python scripts**
**Remebmer that calculating number can used for more than one type of defect, however,calculation position can be used for only one type of defect. It's just a limit of ovito software.**
